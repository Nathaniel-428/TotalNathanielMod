# TotalNathanielMod

This is TotalNathanielMod it contains 99% more Nathaniel_428 and 1% Fionn, that adds up to 200%. Not telling you the other 100% (I will give you brownie points if you can guess what that other 100% is) and it increases your IQ unlike the copycat version, TotalFreedomMod.

Anyway, if you're a god and want to compile this garbage then use your marven type thing to build the jar without a builder's permit.

### RockMod

This plugin is powered by the extremely stable and high-level API known as RockMod, it will give your server a 99999999999% performance boost and will reduce your ping by a lot.
No extra plugins are required to activate RockMod, it's included in the plugin!

Special thanks to @speedxx for making RockMod

### Note

This plugin is purely satire and it's not ment to disrepect the orignal TotalFreedomMod, its members, or its developers.
